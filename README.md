# ImFrame
ImFrame is a lightweight framework designed to provide you with a window and graphical backend for the Dear ImGui library.  Unlike more traditional GUI frameworks, Dear ImGui is designed to be integrated into existing applications with a real-time graphics rendering loop, like you'd typically find in videogames.  ImFrame integrates GLFW for windows management, along with an OpenGL rendering API using glad.

Dear ImGui and ImPlot (an add-on graph rendering library) are also part of the framework, along with backend integration files for OpenGL3 and GLFW.

ImFrame is still in early development, so feedback and bug reports are appreciated.

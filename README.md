# ImFrame ![CI](https://github.com/JamesBoer/ImFrame/workflows/CI/badge.svg)
ImFrame is a lightweight framework designed to provide you with a window and graphical backend for the Dear ImGui library.  Unlike more traditional GUI frameworks, Dear ImGui is designed to be integrated into existing applications with a real-time graphics rendering loop, like you'd typically find in videogames.  

## Third Party Libraries
ImFrame a number of handy third-party libraries.  Some of these are hidden behind ImFrame interfaces, while some are provided as-is for your application's use.

* [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) is an OpenGL-based, cross-platform window management and input handling library.  It uses the zip/libpng license.
* [glad](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad) is an OpenGL loading library.  It uses the MIT license.
* [Native File Dialog Extended](https://github.com/btzy/nativefiledialog-extended) is a library that invokes native file open, save, and folder select dialog boxes.  It uses the zlib license.
